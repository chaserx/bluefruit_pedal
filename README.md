# Bluefruit Pedal

## Problem

My Dad is a musician. He plays guitar among other instruments regularly at
venues in Louisville. Most of his songs and fake books are saved on his iPad.
When playing it's not helpful to have to use your hands to advance the chords
and lyrics displayed. Need a remote device to advance the pages using your
feet like any other guitar pedal.

## Solution

Using a [Adafruit Bluefruit EZ-key](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-bluefruit-ez-key-diy-bluetooth-hid-keyboard/overview) and a couple momemtary footswitches
we can make a simple two-key bluetooth keyboard that sends up-arrow and
down-arrow key commands. One snag though, the aluminium enclosure that usually
used to build standard foot pedal will probably interfere with the bluetooth
signal. So, we'll have to 3D print a pedal enclosure instead.
